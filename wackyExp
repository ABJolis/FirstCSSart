Ok this is a "crazy exp" that I'm going to use to practice undoing something! But, like Atlassian says, I should think in terms of reverting and resetting, not undoing.

Let's see what happens when I revert this. No more of that detached head stuff!

Can I amend this after I add it?

I amended and it felt so good!

I'm nervous about editing my HTML in this repo, but I think I know now how to go back if I do something I don't want to do, thereby averting the worst. Go me!
