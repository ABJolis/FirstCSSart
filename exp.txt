This is an experimental text file within my FirstCSSart repo, that I'm going to play with in order to learn about undoing changes in Git. WHOOPEE!!!

Oh, correction! This file does not currently exist in the FirstCSSart repository, because this was done in a "detached HEAD" state. As Atlassian tells me, "nothing you do here will be saved in your current repository."

Not gonna lie, I'm struggling with the prompts I get after I enter "git commit --amend". They all seem to have a mind of their own and I just have to cancel and quit to even get out of them, to say nothing of actually implementing anything.

Oh hey I made that work! I just type in the new commit message in quotes after "--amend" -- done and done, whoop!

Next up I'll be editing this, as well as wackyExp, to then test oy capabilities for changing committed files. Maybe I'll even edit the html in my CSS art file, WHOA!
