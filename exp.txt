This is an experimental text file within my FirstCSSart repo, that I'm going to play with in order to learn about undoing changes in Git. WHOOPEE!!!

Oh, correction! This file does not currently exist in the FirstCSSart repository, because this was done in a "detached HEAD" state. As Atlassian tells me, "nothing you do here will be saved in your current repository."
